The purpose of the sample code is not showing you how to apply design patterns to a mapReduce algorithm,
since we have already discussed them in the lecture. Rather, it is necessary to be familiar with several
essential APIs(Classes) so that we could turn the algorithm into executable under hadoop execution framework.

Focus on APIs exposed by Hadoop and try to understand the docs.
